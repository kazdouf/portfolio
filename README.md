##Portfolio Repository
Welcome to my portfolio repository! This repository showcases a web application that helps organize the presence and discipline notes for multiple schools within a region or state. The project is built using Core PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, HTML, and CSS.

#Project Overview
The web app aims to streamline the process of managing and tracking attendance and discipline records for schools. It provides a user-friendly interface for administrators and teachers to efficiently record and access data related to student presence and disciplinary incidents. Here are some key features of the application:

User Management: The system allows administrators to create and manage user accounts for teachers and staff members, enabling secure access to the application.

School Management: Administrators can add and manage multiple schools within a region or state. Each school can have its own set of teachers and students.

Attendance Tracking: Teachers can mark the attendance of students on a daily basis, making it easy to keep track of their presence or absence. The system can generate reports and statistics to provide an overview of attendance patterns.

Discipline Notes: Teachers and administrators can record disciplinary incidents involving students, such as behavioral issues or rule violations. The application allows for attaching relevant details, such as incident descriptions, dates, and any actions taken.

#Technologies Used
The project incorporates the following technologies:

Core PHP: The backend logic and server-side functionality of the application are implemented using Core PHP, ensuring efficient data handling and processing.

JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax: These technologies are used to enhance the user experience by adding dynamic behavior and interactivity to the web app. They enable seamless data updates without the need for page reloads.

HTML and CSS: The application's user interface is built using HTML and styled with CSS, providing an intuitive and visually appealing experience to users.

#Additional Components
Apart from the main web application, this repository also contains additional microservices built with React.js. These microservices are designed to be integrated into the admin area of a WordPress website, enabling users to change theme options for a dynamic website. These components are small and focused, enhancing the functionality and customization options for WordPress users.
